brickbreaker
============

This is the first game I ever made. It's written in C, and has a very simple concept.

You simply open the game, choose the first option, using W and S to navigate and Space to select. After that, you write your name and the game will start 'loading'.  Of course, a game like this doesn't have to load, but I did this to make it more cool. 

If the ball hits a brick, there's a chance to some of the power up drops. It can be a heart (a life in the game), or even another ball, which will act like the first ball you get. And they can hit each other!
